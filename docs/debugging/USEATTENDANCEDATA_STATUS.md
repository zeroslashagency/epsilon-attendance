# useAttendanceData Migration - Status Update

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS (Issue Found)

---

## 🔍 What Happened

### Attempted Migration
1. ✅ Created new version using `useAttendanceViewModel`
2. ✅ Mapped DTOs to `ProcessedDayData` format
3. ✅ Maintained backward compatibility
4. ❌ Build failed with circular dependency error

### Issue Identified
- Circular dependency when importing view model hook
- Build error: Module resolution issue
- Likely caused by import chain

### Resolution
- ✅ Restored original `useAttendanceData.ts`
- ✅ Build now successful
- ✅ App works normally

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Problem
The view model hooks (`useAttendanceViewModel`) likely have dependencies that create a circular import when used from `useAttendanceData`.

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Direct Component Migration (RECOMMENDED)
Instead of updating the hook, migrate components directly to use view models:

```typescript
// Skip the hook wrapper
// Update components to use view model directly
import { useAttendanceViewModel } from '@/presentation/hooks';

const { attendances, summary, isLoading } = useAttendanceViewModel({
  employeeCode,
  startDate,
  endDate
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Cleaner architecture
- ✅ Direct migration path
- ✅ Less code

#### Option 2: Fix Circular Dependency
- Investigate import chain
- Restructure imports
- Use dynamic imports
- More complex, not recommended

## 🎯 Revised Strategy

### New Approach: Skip Hook Update

**Instead of:**
```
useAttendanceData (wrapper)
    ↓
useAttendanceViewModel
```

**Do this:**
```
Components
    ↓
useAttendanceViewModel (direct)
```

### Migration Steps

1. **Update Components Directly**
   - Import `useAttendanceViewModel`
   - Replace `useAttendanceData` calls
   - Map data if needed

2. **Keep Old Hook**
   - Leave `useAttendanceData.ts` as-is
   - Components not yet migrated still work
   - Remove hook after all components migrated

3. **Gradual Migration**
   - One component at a time
   - Test thoroughly
   - No breaking changes

---

## 📋 Updated Action Plan

### Step 2: Update Components (NOT Hooks)

**Priority 1:**
1. ✅ `AttendanceSummary.tsx` - Use view model directly
2. ✅ `CurrentAttendanceCard.tsx` - Use view model directly
3. ✅ `AttendancePage.tsx` - Use view model directly

**After all components migrated:**
4. ✅ Remove `useAttendanceData.ts`
5. ✅ Clean up old code

---

## ✅ Current Status

### Working
- ✅ Original `useAttendanceData.ts` restored
- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ All components work
- ✅ View model hooks available

### Next Steps
1. 🔵 Update `AttendanceSummary.tsx` directly
2. 🔵 Skip hook wrapper approach
3. 🔵 Direct component migration

## 🎓 Key Insight

**Don't wrap view models in old hooks!**

The whole point of Clean Architecture is to have components use view models directly. Wrapping them in old hooks defeats the purpose and creates circular dependencies.

**Better approach:**
- Update components to use view models
- Remove old hooks entirely
- Clean, direct architecture

## 📊 Progress

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Create view model hooks | ✅ Done |
| Update useAttendanceData | ❌ Skipped (circular dependency) |
| Update components directly | 🔵 Next |
| Remove old hook | 🔵 Later |

---

**Status:** ✅ READY TO PROCEED  
**Next:** Update `AttendanceSummary.tsx` directly  
**Approach:** Direct view model usage (no wrapper)

🚀 **Lesson learned! Moving forward with direct component migration!** 🚀
